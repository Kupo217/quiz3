# NASA API(Mars Rover Photos)

This little application uses free API provided by NASA in order to get images of mars made by rovers in a certain date. In additon, you can get the exact amount of photos(max. 25),these photo urls and the date will be saved in sqlite3 database(database is created automatically)

I suggest to use date 2015-5-16, since this date is already checked(some dates may not work, since mars rovers do not take pictures of mars daily)

# Thanks for attention
